DuOPolySynth v1. This has attack, release, filter, reverb mix, BlOscillator choice, oscillator choice, chorus depth, chorus freq, oscillator mix and volume. Plus an SSD1306 screen showing the oscillator choice and mix level.
This is all example and library code with a few tweaks to make it work together. 
NB: this is also how not to programme e.g. far too many global variable, use of functions and generally lack of C++ knowledge. Looking to improve this and bring in swap out a few things for v2.0.
